Docker One-Click Installation
-----------------------------------

- Docker One-Click Cloud Deployment: https://help.qiaoqiaoyun.com/open/dockerCloud.html


Mobile H5 Deployment
-----------------------------------

`qiaoqiaoyun_app_h5.zip` in the installation package is the H5 version of the mobile APP (static files only). It can be opened in mobile browsers, DingTalk and WeChat Work. Deploy the backend service first.

**1. Unzip to the server**

```bash
mkdir -p /opt/qiaoqiaoyun-h5
unzip qiaoqiaoyun_app_h5.zip -d /opt/qiaoqiaoyun-h5
```

**2. Set the backend API address**

Edit `/opt/qiaoqiaoyun-h5/_app.config.js`. Set `API_BASE_URL` to your backend address and `SHARE_URL` to the H5 address:

```js
window._appConfig = {"API_BASE_URL":"http://<server-ip>","SHARE_URL":"http://<server-ip>:8051"};
```

**3. Configure Nginx**

The H5 assets use root paths (`/static/...`), so it must be served on its own port or domain, not in a sub-directory:

```nginx
server {
    listen       8051;
    server_name  localhost;
    root         /opt/qiaoqiaoyun-h5;
    index        index.html;

    location / {
        try_files $uri $uri/ /index.html;
    }
}
```

Run `nginx -s reload`, then open `http://<server-ip>:8051` on your phone. The account and password are the same as the PC version.

**4. Set the H5 address in the backend config**

Edit the backend `config/application-prod.yml` and set `jeecg.domainUrl.app` to the H5 address (for Docker, pass the environment variable `JEECG_DOMAIN_URL_APP`), then restart the backend:

```yaml
jeecg:
  domainUrl:
    app: http://<server-ip>:8051
```

> Remember to open port 8051 in the firewall and cloud security group.
